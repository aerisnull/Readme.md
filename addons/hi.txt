Thank you for choosing the Minecraft Pack Addon for Pterodactyl by Obscure404!

To use this addon, simply upload the file "Minecraft Pack for Pterodactyl v1.0.zip" to the root directory of your Pterodactyl panel.
Once the upload is complete, unzip the file and run the following command in your panel root directory:

 > php artisan mcpack

[!] If you are using a theme, we recommend purchasing the addon that matches your theme. However, if your theme is not yet supported, we suggest installing the Minecraft Pack manually by following the instructions in the Manual Installation.txt file. This is because theme file structures often differ, which may cause installation issues when using `php artisan mcpack install`.

[!] We recommend using this universal minecraft java egg by MCJars to make them more suitable for use with the addon. With appreciation to 0x7d8 (https://github.com/0x7d8)
